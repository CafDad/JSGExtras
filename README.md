# JSGExtras
This is the repository for the mod JSG Extras, a mod that is intended to be an addon for things I feel should be added to the famous mod "Just Stargate Mod (Aunis:Resurrection)" by minedragonxz_ and matouss

This mod is not at all associated with the Stargate franchise or the mod team listed above. I made this mod soley to complete my own, and hopefully others, stargate experience. All things added by JSG Extras will be canon to the series
thus any suggestion regarding adding something non-canon to the stargate shows will be an automatical no from me. If you discover any bugs, please report them in the issues section on the github page.
